# This config file is used by cloud-nuke to clean up named resources associated
# with a specific managed cluster across an AWS account. CLUSTER_NAME is
# typically the metadata.name of the ManagedCluster.
# The resources listed here are ALL of the potential resources that can be
# filtered by cloud-nuke, except for IAM resources since we'll never touch those.
# See: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke?tab=readme-ov-file#whats-supported
#
# Usage:
# - 'CLUSTER_NAME=foo make dev-aws-nuke' will nuke resources affiliated with an AWS cluster named 'foo'
# Check cluster names with 'kubectl get managedcluster.hmc.mirantis.com -n hmc-system'
